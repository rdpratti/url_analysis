URL Analysis Project

What do most applications use to make up their URLs? This project analyzes a million URLs described by Amazon as the 'Alexa Top 1 Million Sites'. The file with these URLs is available on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cheedcheed/top1m.

This project analyzes the URLs to determine if there are any patterns around URL naming.
